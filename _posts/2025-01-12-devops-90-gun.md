Fast delivery starts with a clear picture everyone can see. I begin by collecting three core metrics—deployment frequency, lead time, and change fail rate—so the numbers tell us where we stand.

<pre>
<code class="language-javascript" data-filename="api.js" data-github="https://github.com/kadirergun/repo/api.js">
console.log("hello");
</code>
</pre>

## Days 0-30: Take the snapshot
- List bottlenecks in current pipelines/environments; name owners.
- Map every manual prod step; list automation opportunities.
- Pick a pilot repo and lock in automated tests + static analysis + container build.

## Days 30-60: Define the standard
- Create a shared template for all services: build, test, quality gate, image naming, versioning.
- Publish a reusable pipeline/action library plus a sample repo for teams to copy.
- Trial trunk-based branching + feature flags to keep changes small.

## Days 60-90: Productize the platform
- Build shared IaC modules (network, database, observability) and make them self-service.
- Share deployment insights on a dashboard; summarize red areas weekly.
- Simplify the post-mortem template so it’s fillable in 30 minutes.

## Metrics to watch
- Deployment frequency: How many times per week to prod?
- Lead time: Merge to live.
- Change fail rate: Rollback/incident rate for live changes.
- Mean time to recovery: Detecting impact to restoring service health.
