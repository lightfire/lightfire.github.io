DevOps is not a tooling stack—it is a way to keep teams shipping fast without breaking trust.

## Shared ownership keeps quality close to the code
- Developers and operators look at the same dashboards and incident channels.
- Pull requests include deployment and rollback notes so on-call engineers are never surprised.
- Post-incident reviews assign system fixes to product teams, not a separate ops queue.

## Automation protects focus
- Every repo ships with a standard pipeline that runs tests, security scans, and image builds on each commit.
- Infrastructure lives as code with reviewable changes, which reduces drift and keeps environments consistent.
- Release trains and feature flags let teams ship small, reversible changes instead of risky big-bang releases.

## Fast feedback reduces risk
- Observability is part of the definition of done: metrics, logs, and traces are wired before launch.
- Error budgets and SLOs make reliability measurable and create room for experimentation without burnout.
- Customer-facing experiments get telemetry hooks so product and platform teams learn from the same signals.

## How to tell DevOps is working
- Lead time from merge to production is measured in hours, not weeks.
- Deployments are boring because rollbacks are easy and tested.
- Teams spend more time adding value than firefighting, and incident learnings feed directly into backlogs.
